Filter elements that are unique to arr1:

1. arr1.filter(item => !arr2.includes(item))

- This filters elements from arr1 that are not present in arr2. 
- It checks each item from arr1 and returns it only if arr2 does not include that item.

2. Filter elements that are unique to arr2:

arr2.filter(item => !arr1.includes(item))

Similarly, this filters elements from arr2 that are not present in arr1.

3. Combine the results using the spread operator (...):

[ ...arr1.filter(...), ...arr2.filter(...) ] 

combines the unique elements from both arrays into a new array.
