/* String.prototype.charCodeAt()
 
The charCodeAt() method of String values returns an integer between 0 and 65535 
representing the UTF-16 code unit at the given index.

charCodeAt() always indexes the string as a sequence of UTF-16 code units, 
so it may return lone surrogates. 

To get the full Unicode code point at the given index, use String.prototype.codePointAt(). 

Syntax:
    charCodeAt(index)

Parameters
index
    Zero-based index of the character to be returned. 
    Converted to an integer — undefined is converted to 0.

Return value
    An integer between 0 and 65535 representing the UTF-16 code unit value of the character at the specified index. 
    If index is out of range of 0 – str.length - 1, charCodeAt() returns NaN. */

const sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';

const index = 4;

console.log(sentence.charCodeAt(index));
// UTF-16 code unit of "q" is integer 113

console.log(
    `Character code ${sentence.charCodeAt(index)} is equal to ${sentence.charAt(
        index,
    )}`,
);
// Expected output: "Character code 113 is equal to q"
