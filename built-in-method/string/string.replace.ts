/* String.prototype.replace()

The replace() method of String values returns a new string with one, some, 
or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. 

The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, 
and the replacement can be a string or a function called for each match. 

If pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced. 
The original string is left unchanged.

Syntax:
    replace(pattern, replacement)

Parameters:

pattern
    Can be a string or an object with a Symbol.replace method â€” 
    the typical example being a regular expression. 
    Any value that doesn't have the Symbol.replace method will be coerced to a string.

replacement
    Can be a string or a function.
        If it's a string, it will replace the substring matched by pattern. 
            A number of special replacement patterns are supported; 
            see the Specifying a string as the replacement section below.
        If it's a function, it will be invoked for every match 
            and its return value is used as the replacement text. 
            The arguments supplied to this function are described 
            in the Specifying a function as the replacement section below.

Return value
    A new string, with one, some, or all matches of the pattern replaced by the specified replacement.
